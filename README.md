# Flappy Bird Clone

This program is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird. It has a scoring system and will have a highscore system, death screen and menu screen.
Included within the repository is a copy of this readme file, a license file and a python file. I am not taking credit for designing the graphics and/or gameplay. This is just a project that I wanted to challenge myself with.

## Prerequisites

To download Python go to the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) web page and click the yellow button-
under 'Download the latest version for Windows' or select your OS under the yellow button.
